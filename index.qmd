# Who am I?

I am a scientist with 20 years of experience across academia, pharma and tech in the domains of economic decision making, data science, and healthcare analytics. I consider it my job to think deeply, collaborate intentionally, and influence others in order to improve and extend lives.

In practice, I lead the development of data-driven solutions to problems. Sometimes these solutions take the form of a strategic or scientific recommendation. Other times they take the form of a piece of software or scientific report.

When I am not developing solutions, I strive to train and guide others to be more confident and effective in their roles, while learning the same from my own mentors.

# What is this site?

I see this site as a place to write and share my, mostly professional, but also occasionally personal, thoughts on a range of topics. 

The professional topics will range from [data science](blog.html#category=Data%20Science), to [healthcare analytics](blog.html#category=Healthcare%20Analytics), to [organizational](blog.html#category=Organizational) and [leadership](blog.html#category=Leadership). 

The personal ones will be a mixture of [personal](blog.html#category=Personal) reflections and artistic content like [photography](blog.html#category=Photography) 

# What am I doing now?

As of November 2024, after almost 1 year as a stay-at-home father, I am open to new full-time opportunities for scientific leadership with a purpose-driven organization. If you know of an open or upcoming role that I could be a good fit for, please do let me know.

I am also available for consulting on an hourly basis. Contact me to learn more.

# Contact

The best way to get in contact me is via email at nathaniel.d.phillips.is@gmail.com. You can also use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieldphillips/) but I don't check that as often.

## Developer notes

I created this site with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), the content is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ndphillips/ndphillips.github.io)
