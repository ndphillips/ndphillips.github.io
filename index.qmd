# What is this site?

I see this site as a place to write and share my, mostly professional, but also occasionally personal, thoughts on a range of topics. The professional topics will likely range from data science, to healthcare analytics, to organizational leadership. The personal ones will probably be a mixture of personal reflections on my career journey and artistic content like photography. 

## Why create a site? Isn't that pretty 2010?

I have to admit it feels pretty weird to me to be creating a website with the intention of posting regularly. Feels so 2010 right? Other than a few data science rockstars I know, I don't think I know of anyone who maintains a personal website these days. I think I have three main reasons for creating it.

1. I want to write for the sake of writing, but I also want to move away from creating "content" on places like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieldphillips/) (which I do still use, but want to use less). I miss the experience of writing for the sake of writing, not likes.

2. I would like to write a book one day (or a second one if we count [The Pirate's Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)), but I don't know what it would be about. I've heard that many interesting books have come out of blogs, so I thought I would try it and see how it goes.

3. I want a place to share my favorite photos (and other potential artistic endeavors) other than social media.

# Who am I?

I am a scientist with 20 years of experience across academia, pharma and tech in the domains of economic decision making, data science, and healthcare analytics. I consider it my job to think deeply, collaborate intentionally, and influence others in order to improve and extend lives.

In practice, I lead the development of data-driven solutions to problems. Sometimes these solutions take the form of a strategic or scientific recommendation. Other times they take the form of a piece of software or scientific report.

When I am not developing solutions, I strive to train and guide others to be more confident and effective in their roles, while learning the same from my own mentors.

# What am I doing now?

As of November 2024 (the last time I updated this page), I am a full-time stay at home father of an infant. Having a child was one of my biggest life-long dreams and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to spend the first year of his life with him almost every day.

While I love being a stay-at-home Dad, I also love practicing science. For that reason I am open to new full-time opportunities for scientific leadership with a purpose-driven organization. If you know of an open or upcoming role that I could be a good fit for, please do let me know.

I am also available for consulting on an hourly basis. Contact me to learn more.

# Contact

The best way to get in contact me is via email at nathaniel.d.phillips.is@gmail.com. You can also use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieldphillips/) but I don't check that nearly as often.

## Developer notes

I created this site with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), the content is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ndphillips/ndphillips.github.io)
