I'm Nathaniel Phillips, PhD, I'm known for [R Piratery](www.bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr), [data science applications in healthcare](https://posit.co/resources/videos/flatironkitchen-how-we-overhauled-a-frankensteinian-sql-workflow-with-the-tidyverse), and [decision making research](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees).

This website is a place for me to jot down my professional and personal reflections, namely while I'm on an extended parental leave.

Check out my [About](about.qmd), [Resources](resources.qmd), and [Blog](blog.qmd) pages
