## About

I am a Data Scientist with a PhD in Cognitive Psychology who loves helping people solve challenging problems and communicate them to technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

I have experience across academia and industry building products and teams that generate insights from messy data. I'm particularly known for [Healthcare Data Science](https://posit.co/resources/videos/flatironkitchen-how-we-overhauled-a-frankensteinian-sql-workflow-with-the-tidyverse), [Open Source Data Science](www.bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr), and [Decision Making Research](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees).

## Current Role

I am currently working as an independent consultant for healthcare data science.
