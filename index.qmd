I am a scientific leader with over 10 years of experience across academia, pharma and tech in the domains of behavioral decision making, open-source data science tooling, and real-world healthcare analytics. 

Practically speaking, I lead the development of solutions to problems with data, both in terms of process approaches and software implementations. 

When I am not developing solutions, I train and guide junior researchers to be more confident and effective in their roles. 

I believe in always having an aspirational mindset, an ironclad trust that every problem has an idea that will solve it.
