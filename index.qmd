I'm Nathaniel D. Phillips, PhD. I'm known for [R Piratery](www.bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr), [data science applications in healthcare](https://posit.co/resources/videos/flatironkitchen-how-we-overhauled-a-frankensteinian-sql-workflow-with-the-tidyverse), and [decision making research](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees). If that sounds interesting to you, you're in the right place.
