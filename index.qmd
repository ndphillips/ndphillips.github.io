I am a Data Scientist who loves helping people solve challenging problems and tell impact stories to technical and non-technical stakeholders. I have experience across academia and industry building products and teams that generate insights from messy data. 

I'm most well known for [Healthcare Data Science](https://posit.co/resources/videos/flatironkitchen-how-we-overhauled-a-frankensteinian-sql-workflow-with-the-tidyverse), [Open Source Data Science](www.bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr), and [Decision Making Research](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees).

## Consulting

I am currently working as an independent consultant in healthcare data science. I work with clients who want to make it easier to solve problems and answer questions from healthcare data.

See [Consulting](consulting.qmd) to learn more.

## Experience and Education

I have a diverse experience as a research scientist, developer, manager, and team lead across academia and industry. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Grinnell College, A Master's in Experimental Psychology at Ohio University, and a PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Basel.
