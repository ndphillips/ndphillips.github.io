![](assets/portrait_nov2024_zoom.jpg){width=30%}

I am a professional learner and solution designer driven to help people and organizations solve challenging problems and tell impact stories from data. I am passionate about creating tools and systems that reduce waste and empower people to make better decisions.

I am most well known for [Healthcare Data Science](https://posit.co/resources/videos/flatironkitchen-how-we-overhauled-a-frankensteinian-sql-workflow-with-the-tidyverse), [Statistical Programming with R](www.bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr), and [Medical Decision Making](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees).

## Edcuation

- PhD, Cognitive Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland
- MS, Quantitative Psychology, Ohio University, Athens, OH
- BA, Mathematics, Grinnell College, Grinnell, IA

## Experience

I have over 10 years of experience across academia and industry, from large corporations (e.g.; Roche) to small start-ups (e.g.; Plinth Analytics), as a research scientist, statistical software developer, people manager, team lead, chief technology officer, and co-founder. While I have spent most of my career create technical solutions, I leverage my background in decision making psychology to ensure that every solution I design, and every presentation I deliver, are practical and engaging and will actually impact flesh and blood decision makers. At a personal level, I aim to be source of contagious enthusiasm and create a legacy at every organization I'm privileged to be a part of.

See my [About](about.qmd) page or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieldphillips/) to learn more about my experience.

## Projects and Publications

Here is a selection of my work:

### Open Source Projects

- [FFTrees](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees). The R package FFTrees creates, visualizes and evaluates fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) for solving binary classification tasks, using the algorithms and methods described in Phillips, Neth, Woike & Gaissmaier. 

- [yarrr](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/yarrr/). The yarrr package is a collection of tools for teaching introductory statistics and data science with R. It focuses on making complex statistical concepts accessible to beginners and includes a suite of functions for data visualization and statistical testing.

- [The Pirate's Guide to R](https://github.com/ndphillips/ThePiratesGuideToR) is a book that teaches R programming to beginners. It is designed to be accessible to people with no prior programming experience and is used in introductory statistics courses at universities around the world.
