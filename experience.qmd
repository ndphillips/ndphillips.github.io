This page contains an overview of my Education, Work Experience, Presentations and Videos, Publications, and Open Source projects:

## Education

I have a diverse educational background that has shaped my approach to data science and decision making. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to learn from some of the best in the field.

I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Basel and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. I have an MS in Quantitative Psychology from Ohio University and a BA in Mathematics from Grinnell College.

## Work Experience

Here is a selection of my work experience. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieldphillips/) page for a more detailed history.

Most recently, I was the CTO and Co-Founder of [Plinth Analytics](https://www.plinth.co), a company that helps healthcare organizations make better decisions with messy healthcare data. In this role, I led the development of our data science platform and worked with our customers to understand their needs and deliver solutions that helped reduce costs and generate new use-cases.

I am currently a Quantitative Scientist at [Flatiron Health](https://www.flatiron.com), where I work on real-world data science problems in oncology.
