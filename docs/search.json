Clemens, on the left, was the partner of one of my closest friends in Europe (Renata), and quickly became a good friend of mine as well. The girl, on the right, was the daughter of one of the other guests.\nWhat I love the most about this photo is the expression of Clemens and the girl. Clearly they have caught me with my camera to my eye. Those days I had a camera with me pretty much all the time, so I’m sure they weren’t surprised. But looking at the photo now, they give a look like “hey who are you and why are you taking our photo?” Do I trust my memory or the photo? I guess I could ask Clemens.\nI liked this photo so much that I had it printed and framed in my room in Berlin. It may have been the first photo I took that looked like something a “real” portrait photographer would take.\nThis photo was taken with a Sony a6000."

This was just 2 weeks after our family moved from Brooklyn, NY to Portland. We were in the middle of a stressful move and we decided we had to take a break and do one of my favorite things, during my favorite time of year - visit a pumpkin patch 1 in the Fall!\nMy favorite part of the photo is the expression of the cook. He is the centerpiece of the photo. If he wasn’t there, this would be a much more boring photo. He has piercing eyes and I like how his vintage Nike hat adds to his style. I also like the contrast between the hard lines of the door and siding, compared to the comparatively messy collection of pumpkins and ketchup and mustard dispensers.\nThis photo was taken with a Ricoh GR."

Other than a few data science rockstars I know, I don’t think I know of anyone who maintains a personal website these days. I think I have three main reasons for creating it.\n\nI want to write for the sake of writing, but I also want to move away from creating “content” on places like LinkedIn (which I do still use, but want to use less). I miss the experience of writing for the sake of writing, not likes.\nI would like to write a book one day (or a second one if we count The Pirate’s Guide to R), but I don’t know what it would be about. I’ve heard that many interesting books have come out of blogs, so I thought I would try it and see how it goes.\nI want a place to share my favorite photos (and other potential artistic endeavors) other than social media."

    "section": "My core beliefs",
    "text": "My core beliefs\nThe longer I live as a human, the more I recognize how important it is to have a set of core beliefs that you can fall back on when you’re struggling to make a decision – or alternatively, that you can start every situation with as a foundational framework. I’ve fallen for the trap, too many times, of thinking a difficult new situation calls for a “clean slate” approach. Even worse, at times when I feel particularly confident, I go in like an uncaged bull thinking I already know the solution and fail to adapt to to the particular needs of the people and environment at hand.\nRather than taking one of these two extremes, I’m finding it far more effective to take a third route: Start with a set of core beliefs, then ask questions and gather information. Let the right approach evolve naturally until the correct decision becomes obvious.\nDistilling my rolling journey of ideas, lessons, and intentions into a set of core beliefs is an exercise I’ve tried many times, but never seemed to keep track of. Let me try again here.\n\nHave a Growth Mindset\nI believe in having a growth mindset. I see a growth mindset as an ironclad trust that every problem has an idea that will solve it and that you can discover through curiosity, collaboration, and hard work.\n\n\nDecide with Heuristics\nI believe in making decisions using heuristics. I fell in love with the heuristic decision making philosophy of Gerd Gigerenzer during my PhD, and I have carried this philosophy with me throughout my personal and professional life. I would describe this philosphy as: Success comes not from having perfect information, but from making risky decisions based on the best information available, while always being prepared to change course if we discover something new.\n\n\nPrioritize Transparency\nI believe in transparency. Both in science and in life. For science, this belief has caused me to be a staunch advocate for open-source tools like R.\n\n\nCreate Opportunities for Flow\nI believe that the state of flow is the closest things humans have to a super-power. In periods of flow I have created things that I am immensely proud of (like FFTrees). By contrast, in periods of distraction, the best I can do is something mediocre."

One of my favorite things to do with my father was to go to a used bookstore and find the oldest looking math books I can find and flip through them, dreaming that one day I’d actually understand them. In 2005, after 4 years of long evenings and intense study sessions, I obtained a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa with a focus on probability and statistics. Earning this degree continues to be one of my greatest sources of pride.\nI then earned a Masters degree in Psychology with a focus on quantitative methods from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. I completed my PhD in Psychology with a focus on quantitative models of human judgment and decision making from the University of Basel in Basel Switzerland.

None of these roles has been a perfect fit, but I can geniuinely say that I have learned something new about myself and the world in each one.\nWhile I have spent most of my career creating technical solutions, I use my background in the psychology of decision making to ensure that every solution I design, and every presentation I deliver, is practical, engaging and has a high likelihood of actually being put into practice by decision makers. I have gotten much better at impacting people over time, not because I’m a natural, but because I haven’t been afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.\nAt a personal level, I gain sincere joy from seeing users enjoy using a tool I’ve designed. I gain even more joy helping a junior team member accomplish more than they thought they could.

They are mostly in experimental or cognitive psychology journals. I note that none of my publications are very recent (my latest paper was published in 2018) as I have not worked on academic projects in quite a while.\n\n  \n\nA screenshot from my 2019 Posit Conf talk: How we overhauled a Frankensteinian SQL workflow with the tidyverse. This is, quite literaly, the moment I realized my new passion for developing data science solutions exceeded that of conducting for academic research.\n\n\nBelow is a list of all the presentations I’ve given that are available online (at least as far as I know):\n\nFFTrees: An R package to create, visualise and use fast and frugal decision trees, useR!, 2017\nUsing R to Derive Robust Insights from Real-World Health Care Data, R/Pharma, 2022\nFlatironKitchen: How we overhauled a Frankensteinian SQL workflow with the Tidyverse, RStudio Conf, 2019\n\n\n\n\nThe output created by the FFTrees decision making algorithm and accompanying R package.\n\n\nI have built and maintained dozens of open-source data science packages packages and instructional materials over the years. Most, but not all of my projects are available at https://github.com/ndphillips.\nAll are built using the R programming language which I’ve developed quite some expertise in. Well, that is a bit of an understatement as over the course of almost 15 years, I used and loved R almost to the point of obsession.\nHere are the 3 most popular open source projects I’ve developed:\n\nFFTrees. The R package FFTrees creates, visualizes and evaluates fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) for solving binary classification tasks, using the algorithms and methods described in Phillips, Neth, Woike & Gaissmaier.\nyarrr. The yarrr package is a collection of tools for teaching introductory statistics and data science with R. It focuses on making complex statistical concepts accessible to beginners and includes a suite of functions for data visualization and statistical testing.\nThe Pirate’s Guide to R is a book that teaches R programming to beginners. It is designed to be accessible to people with no prior programming experience and is used in introductory statistics courses at universities around the world. Be warned – its writing style reflects the good (and bad) of a 25-ish year old grad student."
