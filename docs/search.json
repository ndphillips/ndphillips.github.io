In 2005, after 4 years of long evenings and intense study sessions, I obtained a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa. Earning this degree continues to be one of my greatest sources of pride.\nI then earned a Masters degree in Psychology with a focus on quantitative methods from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. I completed my PhD in Psychology with a focus on quantitative models of human judgment and decision making from the University of Basel in Basel Switzerland. Note: My PhD research was jointly conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany."

None of these roles has been a perfect fit, but I can geniuinely say that I have learned something new about myself and the world in each one.\nWhile I have spent most of my career creating technical solutions, I use my background in the psychology of decision making to ensure that every solution I design, and every presentation I deliver, is practical, engaging and has a high likelihood of actually being put into practice by decision makers. I have gotten much better at impacting people over time, not because I’m a natural, but because I haven’t been afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.\nAt a personal level, I gain sincere joy from seeing users enjoy using a tool I’ve designed. I gain even more joy helping a junior team member accomplish more than they thought they could. As it may come as no surprise, I aim to be source of contagious enthusiasm and create a legacy at every organization I’m a part of.\nSee my Resume page or LinkedIn for a detailed list of my professional experience."

They are mostly in experimental or cognitive psychology journals. I note that none of my publications are very recent (my latest paper was published in 2018) as I have not worked on academic projects in quite a while.\n\n  \n\nA screenshot from my 2019 Posit Conf talk: How we overhauled a Frankensteinian SQL workflow with the tidyverse. This is, quite literaly, the moment I realized my new passion for developing data science solutions exceeded that of conducting for academic research.\n\n\nBelow is a list of all the presentations I’ve given that are available online (at least as far as I know):\n\nFFTrees: An R package to create, visualise and use fast and frugal decision trees, useR!, 2017\nUsing R to Derive Robust Insights from Real-World Health Care Data, R/Pharma, 2022\nFlatironKitchen: How we overhauled a Frankensteinian SQL workflow with the Tidyverse, RStudio Conf, 2019\n\n\n\n\nThe output created by the FFTrees decision making algorithm and accompanying R package.\n\n\nI have built and maintained dozens of open-source data science packages packages and instructional materials over the years. Most, but not all of my projects are available at https://github.com/ndphillips.\nAll are built using the R programming language which I’ve developed quite some expertise in. Well, that is a bit of an understatement as over the course of almost 15 years, I used and loved R almost to the point of obsession.\nHere are the 3 most popular open source projects I’ve developed:\n\nFFTrees. The R package FFTrees creates, visualizes and evaluates fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) for solving binary classification tasks, using the algorithms and methods described in Phillips, Neth, Woike & Gaissmaier.\nyarrr. The yarrr package is a collection of tools for teaching introductory statistics and data science with R. It focuses on making complex statistical concepts accessible to beginners and includes a suite of functions for data visualization and statistical testing.\nThe Pirate’s Guide to R is a book that teaches R programming to beginners. It is designed to be accessible to people with no prior programming experience and is used in introductory statistics courses at universities around the world."

    "text": "I am a scientist with over 10 years of experience across academia, pharma and tech in the domains of behavioral decision making, open-source data science, and healthcare analytics. I consider it my job to think deeply, discover hidden truths, and communicate what I’ve learned to decision makers who can create meaningful change.\nPractically speaking, I lead the development of data-driven solutions to problems. Sometimes these solutions take the form of a strategic or scientific recommendation. Other times they take the form of a piece of software or scientific report. Either way, these solutions are delivered with a recognition of what we know and what we don’t. We will never have perfect information and cannot wait until we do (spoiler alert: we never will). Any important scientific or organizational decision will inherently involve risk and success is never guaranteed. Success comes not from having perfect information, but from making bold decisions based on the best information we have available, while always being prepared to change course if we discover critical new information.\nI believe strongly in the power of a growth mindset – an ironclad trust that every problem has an idea that will solve it. By combining curiosity, collaboration, and perseverance, we will discover that idea, and build something better than we ever could have imagined.\nWhen I am not developing solutions, I strive to train and guide others to be more confident and effective in their roles, while learning the same from my own mentors."
