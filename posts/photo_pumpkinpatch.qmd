# Backstory

I took the "Pick Up Here" at The Pumpkin Patch on Sauvie Island in Portland, OR. This was just 2 weeks after our family moved from Brooklyn, NY to Portland. We were in the middle of a stressful move and we decided we had to take a break and do one of my favorite things, during my favorite time of year - visit a pumpkin patch [^1] in the Fall!

# What I like

My favorite part of the photo is the expression of the cook. He is the centerpiece of the photo. If he wasn't there, this would be a much more boring photo. He has piercing eyes and I like how his vintage Nike hat adds to his style. I also like the contrast between the hard lines of the door and siding, compared to the comparatively messy collection of pumpkins and ketchup and mustard dispensers.
