*Notes*

This is one of my all-time favoite photos. I took it on July 4, 2015 in Berlin at a park during a picnic with friends. Clemens, on the left, was the partner of one of my closest friends in Europe (Renata), and quickly became a good friend of mine as well. The girl, on the right, was the daughter of one of the other guests.

What I love the most about this photo is the expression of Clemens and the girl. Clearly they have caught me with my camera to my eye. Those days I had a camera with me pretty much all the time, so I'm sure they weren't surprised. But looking at the photo now, they give a look like "hey who are you and why are you taking our photo?" Do I trust my memory or the photo? I guess I could ask Clemens.

I liked this photo so much that I had it printed and framed in my room in Berlin. It may have been the first photo I took that looked like something a "real" portrait photographer would take. 

This photo was taken with a Sony a6000.
