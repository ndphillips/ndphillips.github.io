*Notes*

I took "Bag on Table" during a trip with my two best friends from college Patrick and Doja. Detoit was one of, I think, three destinations on our road trip starting from Grinnell, IA and ending in Cincinatti OH. This shot is of the living room of an Airbnb in Detroit that looked like it hadn't been touched since the 1960s. I distinctly remember the stove in the kitchen looking like an antique that surely was there only for staging, but in fact worked just fine.

Looking back on the photo now, I still remember the feeling I had when I looked into the room and said "Oh this lighting is begging to be photographed." I feel the same way now. My only question is what's in that bag on the center table. Most likely a cheap alcoholic beverage suited for three guys reliving their college days.

*Gear*

This photo was taken either with a Sony a6000 or a Canon 60d, I can't remember which.
