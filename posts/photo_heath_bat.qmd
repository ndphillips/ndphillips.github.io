*Notes*

I took this photo of my nephew Heath in the days leading up to my wedding at Lourdes Camp in Skaneateles NY. In the background, you can see the corner of the nurses station on the left (which doubles as the couple's suite during weddings), the green cafeteria (enough from for 300 campers or wedding guests) and bounce house[^1].

I love this photo for Heath's expression and pose. It's clear I caught him in the middle of play (see the soccer ball on the left). I imagine his 4 cousins are just off frame waiting for him. Heath is a very expressive guy, so it's rare to see him not with a huge smile or making a funny face, espcially for the camera. Here, I've caught him in an apparent moment of calm focus and utter confidence. If I were playing I'd want him on my team any day.

*Gear*

This photo was taking witha Fujifilm X100V.

[^1]: Renting a bounce house for our wedding was the best financial decidion we made. For about $250 bucks, the kids were happy for hours. Even over a year later, I still hear stories about it from kids that were there.
