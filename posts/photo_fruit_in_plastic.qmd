*Notes*

During my time as a stay-at-home father to a newborn in Brookyln, NY, I took many photo walks with my son in his stroller and my beloved Ricoh GR in my hand. I took 'Fruit in Plastic' in September 2024, my last month in Brooklyn before moving to Portland, OR.

I'm sure this bag caught my eye because even in NY, I hadn't seen something like this before. I imagine that the owner of the brownstone had some fruit they couldn't use and decided to leave it out for anyone to take. If so, that's a special person as most people wouldn't take the time to do this and instead just throw it out.

Aside from the mystery of where this came from, I do love the contrast in colors and textures between the 4 central materials in the image: brown stone, iron railing, plastic bag, and organic fruit.

This photo was taken with a Ricoh GR.
