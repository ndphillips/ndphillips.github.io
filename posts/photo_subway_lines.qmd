*Notes*

Halloween is my favorite holiday (and general vibe). Looking back at this photo which I took in September 2024 in NYC, I'm sensing some Halloween / horror vibes, so I titled it 'NYC Subnway Horror'. It's the combination of the stark flourescent light, the yellow path and wall lines leading towards an area blocked off (hidden?) by a wall, and then the ominous rust on the subway tiles in the background. I could see this, with the flourescent light flickering, as the opening scene to my next[^1] favorite horror film.

*Gear*

This photo was taking with a Ricoh GR

[^1]: Hard to pick my favorite horror film, but [Evil Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead), [It](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/) and [The Invitation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400463/) would all be in the running.
