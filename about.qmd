This page contains an overview of my Education, Work Experience, Presentations and Videos, Publications, and Open Source projects:

## Education

- Ph.D, Cognitive Psychology, [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch), [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en)
    - I am grateful to have completed my PhD in some of the top decision making research institutions in the world. My experiences there will forever shape how I approach scientific research.
- M.S,  Quantitative Psychology, [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu)
    - I loved teaching introductory statistics and seeing the light in students' eyes when 'it clicked'
- B.A, Mathematics, [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu)
    - Studying mathematics has always been one of my greatest pleasures. Grinnell's [Burling Library](https://www.grinnell.edu/spaces/burling-library) was my happy place

## Work Experience
