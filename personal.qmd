## Principles

Here are my core principles which guide my work and life:

1. Useful. If it's not useful, then what's the point?
2. Clear. I loathe unnecessary complexity,
3. Respectful.  We don't all share the same values, and beliefs. That's a good thing.
4. Resourceful. Wasted resources here could have been used elsewhere.
5. Humble. I've been wrong before, and I'll be wrong again.

## Rolling list of interests

* [Nov 2024] I'm pretty into anything cyberpunk / synthwave these days. Especially [Gunship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC5TBv3sfU&ab_channel=GUNSHIPMUSIC). For that reason I updated this site to use the "Cyberpunk aesthetic" [vapor](https://bootswatch.com/vapor/) theme. I'm sure I'll change it to something more basic when the novelty wears off.
